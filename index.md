## About Me

I am currently a Phd student in the Department of Computer Science at [Trinity College dublin](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/). I am being adviced by [Prof. Doug Leith](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Doug.Leith/). 

My current research focuses on privacy preserving machine learning. Especially how we can make the data used for training these machine learning models more secure.
